# Feed Reader Testing

This feed reader application comes equipped with several Jasmine test suites. To open the application and run the tests, simply open index.html in your browser.

You will see the initial application page, and under it all the tests that ran. The tests are the following:

* Is the array containing the feeds (allFeeds) defined?
* Does the array contain URLs?
* Does the array contain the feed names?

* Is the menu invisible when the app first loads?
* Does menu visibility toggle when the menu icon is clicked?

* After initial loading, does <div class="feed"> contain at least one <article class="entry"> element?

* When changing feeds, do the elements of the <div class="feed"> change?
